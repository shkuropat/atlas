/**
 * Control Plane.

 * Control Plane represents communication between server and client(s).
 * Communication is logically structured into the following areas:
 *
 *   - Commands. Commands flow into both directions, thus server can send commands to clients and clients can send
 *     commands to server. Commands is usually a long-live connection, in order for clients and server
 *     to receive commands with minimal delay. However, nothing prevents clients to connect to server
 *     from time to time as necessary and exchange commands.
 *
 *   - DataChunks. DataChunks flow into both directions, thus server can send data stream to clients and clients
 *     can send data stream to Server. Some commands can be followed by bulk data steamed from client and/or server.
 *
 *   - Metrics. Metrics are sent from client to server in order for server to keep track of client's activities.
 *
 *   - Status. Status requests are sent from client to server in order to check status of the entity(es). Status calls
 *     are usually used for "check status and send updates" logic.
